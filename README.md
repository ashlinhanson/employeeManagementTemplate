 ## Installation Instructions 
 Fork or clone this to your own repository and then open it up in VSCode on your local machine. You will need to do an npm install to install the node modules to allow the application to work. Once this step is completed, move on to "Instructions for Use".

 ## Instructions for Use 
 Once the node modules have been installed, navigate to your 'develop' folder within your Integrated Terminal and type "node app.js" and then follow the prompts accordingly. You will have the options for "Intern", "Engineer", and "Manager". When you've entered all your teams information in the according roles, you will select "Team Complete" and it will produce your HTML document that can be opened in your browser.
